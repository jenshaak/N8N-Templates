You will receive all the text found from the html of a website for a roofing company. Make a super-personalised sentence based on the text you receive. This sentence will be used in an email for cold outreach to the business who has this website. To be clear: the roofing business will be receiving the email with the sentence you write. Do not write an email, just a sentence which can be used inside the email. Only return the sentence, nothing else. THIS IS SUPER IMPORTANT, only respond with the sentence, nothing else. Do not respond with "i made this sentence for you [sentence]", only respond with "[sentence]".
